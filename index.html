        Justin got his start in music at the age of 4 with a 1987 yamaha PSR-2 which he still has and uses today. The keyboard quickly became his favorite toy and music never left him since. Around age 16, he began his journey into computer music after being given a CD with a FL studio 4 demo version on it. Fast-forward 13 years later, the now  29 year old producer/composer has explored almost every genre of music before finding his current musical identity: Justin Waves. The goal of the project was to ignore all trends, completely go out into uncharted territory and tie all of the production skills he has acquired along the way with his own Vocals. The result is a colorful tonal landscape that follows a similar format to artists like Bob Moses, Rufus, and ZHU. Though a good amount of Justin's vocal work provide minimal thought provoking segments that meld into the groove, songs like “Will you be There” provide more of a traditional storying-telling lyrics and showcase his pop sensibilities. Live sets employ a mixture of singing, live instruments and DJing, as well as live analog synth automation all made possible through Ableton wizardry. Currently independent Justin has released his first EP on Bandcamp which is now available free for a limited time.
